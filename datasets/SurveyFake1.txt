Looking for another app."|"For something that is supposed to comprehensive, I am disappointed that the app lacks allowing you to set a start date, end date, and designate progress for tasks. This app doesn't meet my needs, as most of my tasks are not associated with a single date."|"Nice looking UI, but inability to disable popups is a deal breaker for me. Uninstalled."|"The is good and is really helpful when i plan my day. I have problem with the widget that has task and calender,problem is if i had a task that had to be done yesterday and i schedule it to do today,it doesnot show on calendar tasks but it shows in task list. If that could be solved experience using the app will improve"|96|"Business Operations"|"2011"|"2"|"4"|"6"|"6"|"2"|"6"|"6"|"4"|"5"|"4"|"2"|"6"|"4"|"6"|NA|"7"
"Cant change default theme to black ! It asks to change me plan from free to premium before doing so !!"|"This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher"|"Worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with Alexa. I only use this app as a shopping list with Alexa, but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless. The purpose of the list is so that I don't have to remember the 10 items I told Alexa to add to the list (which show up on todoist)"|"Reminders not working after configurations."|"Very useful app if you are in the habit of forgetting things. But it has one major defect. If you have set up a recurring reminder and if you miss one instance of that reminder, further instances will never show up. They are gone forever. I had to pay a penalty fee for late payment into my credit card because of that ridiculous bug."|97|"Business Operations"|"2015"|"8"|"3"|"3"|"4"|"6"|NA|"6"|"1"|"2"|"3"|"3"|NA|"7"|"7"|"8"|"2"
"I am unable to subscribe app payment method declined"|"Premium support has not contacted me for 3 days and counting......"|"Can't change font sizes (old guy) and even with premium trial, can not change recurring task to monthly day of month from monthly day of week. Or, I should say you can make the change, but next time viewing task it shows - repeat every third Monday of the month - rather than - every month on the 20th. Also, I don't see a way to force sync account, . . . if that matters."|"Excellent app But... Google Assistant support / integration is in \"coming soon\" state for about 2 yeas. Is there a chance to see it available in next 5 or 10 years?"|"Update to my original review -- to clarify, I'm saying that in previous versions you could choose which list to put the task under when doing a quick add of it via the \"+\" widget on home screen, and same for adding it from the bottom quick bar in the app. In the current version, it doesn't allow you to choose the list when doing a quick add. Your reply to my review is describing the regular (long) way of adding the task. I want to be able to choose the list when quick adding from the \"+\" widget!"|98|"Business Operations"|"2011"|"2"|"3"|"5"|"7"|NA|"1"|"3"|"2"|"2"|"7"|"2"|"6"|"8"|"3"|"7"|"7"
"Theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum. They make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments, that's just how most of these apps work. You're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this."|"What the hackkkk I tried but it dsnt want get selled... Its not accpting any option of payment get way... I tried debit card, upi,... I love this app and want to purchase it plz resolve it"|"Hard-to-read interface. Tiny font makes it such a strain. No contrast option available either, as far as I can tell. Reminder times are displayed in an even more unfriendly font. Not everyone has perfect vision. Disappointed that the creators of this app haven't thought this through."|"Waste of money and they won't let you delete the account. I am very unhappy!!! Sorry, just venting because I don't have all that much of social life."|"the simple layout makes navigation easy and intuitive. I decided to try this as an alternative to Google calendar and whislt its integration of AI assistants and task tracking seems very good, as a calendar I have to say im not impressed. Looking at the calendar from a months perspective doesnt show at a glance which days you have something happening, rather, below the calendar is a schedule view which shows you what events you have which i find confusing. Would be nice to view by month."|99|"Business Operations"|"2010"|"4"|"6"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"3"|"6"|"1"|"8"|"5"|"1"|"4"|"2"|"2"|"4"|"5"
"Manage subscription is not given in the app menu"|"Charged for subscription after cancelling trial and not even using the app."|"Heavily intrusive, pop-ups each time phone is unlocked. Monetized. Poorly designed, difficult to make custom named to-do lists"|"Not paying $3 a month for something my calendar can do"|"Not sure why but sometimes when I make an edit on one of the items on the list, next time I open the app the changes are not saved. Happened couple times already and I'm sure I clicked the check mark to save the item before leaving the app. A bit annoying"|100|"Business Operations"|"2017"|"8"|"4"|"7"|"7"|"3"|"3"|"4"|"2"|"2"|"2"|"3"|"2"|"1"|"6"|"4"|"5"
